## Notification 

A newer, more noise-robust, more accurate version to Bayesian-SINDy - `:star:` [ODR-BINDy](https://github.com/llfung/ODR-BINDy) `:star:`- is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/llfung/ODR-BINDy). Go check it out!

# Bayesian Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (Bayesian-SINDy) 

Model discovery from data for nonlinear dynamical systems using type-II maximum likelihood in the Bayesian statistics, i.e. maximising evidence (or marginal likelihood). 

Derived from the original [SINDy](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1517384113) paper _"Discovering governing equations from data: Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems"_ in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, **113**(15):3932-3937, 2016, by S. L. Brunton, J. L. Proctor, and J. N. Kutz.

This code is part of [this article](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2024.0200)Â by L. Fung, U. Fasel and M. P. Juniper.

## Using the code

### Getting started (without `SparseBayes` )
1. Run one of the `.m` script in MATLAB at the top level folder and start exploring!

### (Optional) To run `SparseBayes` for comparison
1. Download the `SparseBayes` package [here](https://www.miketipping.com/downloads/SB2_Release_200.zip)
2. Unzip the folder and place it in this current folder.
3. Run one of the `.m` script at the top level folder.
